# QML Fractal Fern

Check out the jupyter notebook [fern.ipynb](https://github.com/towynlin/qml-fern-fractal/blob/main/fern.ipynb).

I built it with python 3.10.
You can run it yourself like this after cloning the repo:

```
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

Enjoy!
